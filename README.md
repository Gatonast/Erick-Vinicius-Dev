# Hi there, I'm @Gatonast 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm the creator behind **Nast Studio** and I'm passionate about building **3D indie games**. Combining programming, art, and creativity, I aim to bring immersive worlds to life.

## 👀 What I’m interested in:
- Working on **3D indie games** with a focus on game development and **3D modeling** (environments, objects, and assets).
- Exploring creative ways to tell stories through game mechanics and art.
  
## 🌱 Currently learning:
- **Unity**: Developing games with one of the best game engines out there.
- **Blender**: Crafting **3D models** for environments, objects, and other assets.
- **C#**: Programming in C# to bring my game ideas to life.

## 💞️ Looking to collaborate on:
- **Indie game projects** where I can contribute with both coding and **3D asset creation** (mainly for environments and objects).
- If you're working on a game and need help with programming, modeling, or game design, feel free to reach out!

## ⚡ Fun fact:
- **I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of building entire worlds from scratch**, whether through code or 3D models. It’s like being a digital architect!
